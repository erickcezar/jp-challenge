Reasons to add/update dependencies in setup.py file:

The conda installed different packages and specific versions for the application to work locally. But when I tried to deploy using docker, the errors occurred according to the links provided. So I decided to use the versions in the environment_dev.yml file, which worked in docker.

- Adding bitname chart repo
  -> the stable repository was deprecated so I used bitnami's to get the same services.
  
- Change secret ref in orders app due bitnami postgres change the password key ref:

From:

            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: db-postgresql
                key: postgresql-password

To: 

            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: db-postgresql
                key: postgres-password

- Add orders database on the new helm chart:

	helm upgrade db bitnami/postgresql --install \
		--set global.postgresql.auth.database=orders
